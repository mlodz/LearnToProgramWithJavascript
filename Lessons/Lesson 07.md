# Lesson 7

### Fun with Colors

Remember how you can create text with colors like this: `write("something", "green")`. You may have tried other common colors, like "red" and "orange", and my personal favorite, "blue". But did you think to try colors like "Teal", "DarkSeaGreen", and "PowderBlue"? Probably not, because who in their right mind would ever think of colors like that? So here's the full list of colors you can use: http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/

Notice that the color name is case-insensitive (which is a fancy way of saying that uppercase and lowercase do not matter). That means you can use "ORANGE" or "orange" or even "OrAnGe" and they all work the same. 

If there aren't enough colors on that page, take a look at this: http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ . Play around with the color picker, and you'll notice you can choose any color. That's right, any color in the world! Once you've found a color you like, take a look at the hex value. It should be a `#` followed by six letters or numbers, such as `#3A664D` or `#00FF00`. Copy the hex value on the page, and then you can use it in your code like this: `write("I found a new color!", "#3A664D")`.


### Set the Page Color

You can set the background color of the page like this: `pageColor("skyblue")`

### Set the Page Title

And you can set the page title and color, like this: `pageTitle("Daylon's Cool Program", "ROYALBLUE")`
