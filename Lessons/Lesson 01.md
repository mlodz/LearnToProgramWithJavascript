# Lesson 1: Your First Program!

Take a look at `projects.js`. You should see this:

```javascript
async function main() {

};
```

Go ahead and write the following line `write("Hello World")`. Your file should look like this:

```javascript
async function main() {

      write("Hello World");

};
```

Go to your web browser and hit refresh. Do you see the words `Hello World` on the white page? If so, then Congratulations! You just wrote your first program!

Try adding another line underneath the previous: `write("I love writing code!")` and then refresh the page. You should see `I love writing code!` on the page now.

Now add this line: `// write("This is getting too easy.")` and refresh the page. What do you see? If you did it correctly, you will NOT see the words `This is getting easy`. The reason is, `//` is how you write comments in your code. Comments are crucial to writing good code; they allow you to describe what the code does, so others can understand when they read your code. Anything in a comment is ignored by the computer.
