# Lesson 2: Numbers

This exercise has lots of math symbols. Let's name them right away so you know what they are called. As you type this one in, say the name. When saying them feels boring you can stop saying them. Here are the names:

- `+` plus
- `-` minus
- `/` slash
- `*` asterisk
- `%` modulo
- `<` less-than
- `>` greater-than
- `<=` less-than-equal
- `>=` greater-than-equal
- `==` equal to

Type all of the following code. DO NOT COPY AND PASTE, it is important to learn to type code. Practice makes perfect.

Before you run the code, can you predict what will appear on the screen?

```javascript
async function main() {

      write("What is 5 plus 3?")
      write(5 + 3);
      
      write("What is 12 times 2?")
      write(12 * 2);
      
      write("Wow, and what is 9812 divided by 2?")
      write(98127 / 2)

}
```

Try some more examples.

```
      write("Is it true that 5 is less than 10?")
      write(5 < 10)

      write("Is 8 less than 3?")
      write(8 < 3)

      write("Is it true that  is 7 is equal to 4 + 3?")
      write(7 == 4 + 3)

```

## Study Drills
1. Above each line, use `//` to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
2. You've tried `>`, but have you tried `>=`? Can you explain how they are different? If you don't know, try some examples. 
3. Try these two examples. Can you predict the result? Can you explain why it displays what it does?
  - `write(4 + 3 * 2)`
  - `write((4 + 3) * 2)`
4. Have you been typing everything like I asked? Remember, you cannot get faster at typing unless you Practice Practice Practice!
5. What does `%` do? It's not obvious, so try some more examples.

## Notes
1. Sometimes you'll see semicolons at the end of a line, like this `write(10);`. But other times you won't, like this: `write(10)`. Why the difference? In the early days of Javascript, the compiler required semicolons at the end of each line to figure out the coder's intention. But nowadays, our compilers are advanced enough that we no longer need semicolons at the end of lines. You may use them or not, it is your choice.
