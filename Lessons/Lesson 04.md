# Lesson 4 - the if statement

An important part of any program is the `if` statement. Type out this code to see what it does. Once you have run it, comment each line so you undertstand what is happening.

```javascript
async function main() {

    if (5 > 8) {
        write("Five is greater than eight.");
    }

    if (100 < 200) {
        write("One hundred is less than 200")
    }

    var name = "Daylon";
    if (name == "Daylon") {
        write("Hello, Daylon! You're doing a great job!");
    } else {
        write("Hello, who are you?");
    }

}
```
