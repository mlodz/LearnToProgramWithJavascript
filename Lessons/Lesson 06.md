# Lesson 06 - Practice!

## Some Cool Stuff

Did you know you can pass a color as a second argument to `write`? Go ahead and try
```
write("The sky is blue", "blue")
```

There's another function that will be helpful. Try `write(random(1, 5))`. Can you figure out what it does? What if you pass in different numbers?
