# Setup

This exercise has no code. It is simply the exercise you complete to get your computer to run Javascript.

#### Download a Text Editor

There are many text editors, and it's your choice. I'd recommend https://atom.io/

#### View some Code

In your text editor, open the file `LearnToProgramWithJavascript/project.js`

It should look like this:
```javascript
async function main() {

};
```
You may notice some of the text is colored. Don't worry if the colors don't match what you see here.

#### View the Output

In your web browser, open the file `LearnToProgramWithJavascript/index.html`. You should see a grey screen with an empty white page.
