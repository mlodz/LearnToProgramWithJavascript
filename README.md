# What is this?

This project is an introduction course on programming, intended for kids ages 10 and up.
To be clear, this is not a Javascript course, it is a programming course, which happens to use Javascript. If you are already familiar with the basics of programming, (variables, loops, functions) this is not the course for you.

Requirements
1. A computer with a web browser and a text editor (more on this in the Setup section).
2. A willingness to learn to program.
